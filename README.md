# A silly 404 page adventure game

Instead of displaying the usual 'Not found' page, treat your clueless
visitor with a browser version of the ancient 1976 'Colossal Cave Adventure'
game instead!

## Installation instructions

Place all the files wherever you wish your 404 page to be. Don't forget the
fonts under its own directory.

Then you'll have to change the `advent.html` file to whatever your system
expects it to be. For instance, for an empty directory (e.g. a placeholder for a
future website), just rename it to `index.html`.

'True' 404 error pages _may_ be possible with your particular choice of webserver;
if so, you'll need to figure out how these files are written and where they are
stored.

  Sadly I have no idea what the license is on the original ADVENT code,
  so I have no idea what licenses are actually available for modified versions.
